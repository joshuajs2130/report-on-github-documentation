  # GITHUB DOCUMENTATION
 
 # WHAT IS GIT AND GITHUB :
 -> Git and GitHub are the development platforms which help developers to host and review code,manage projects,and build software alongside millions of other developers. 
 -> Git is the open source distributed version control system that facilitates GitHub activities on your laptop or desktop.
  
 # REPOSITORY:
 -> A repository is usually used to organize a single project. 
 -> Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets anything your project needs.
 
 # CREATING A REPOSITORY:
 1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the (+) drop-down menu, and select New repository.
 2. In the Repository name box, enter hello-github.
 3. In the Description box, write a short description.
 4. Select whether your repository will be Public or Private.
 5. Click Create repository.
 
 # BRANCH:
  -> Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
 
  # CREATING A BRANCH:
  1.Click the Code tab of your hello-github repository.
  2.Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says main.
  3.Type a branch name, "readme-edits", into the text box.
  4.Click Create branch: readme-edits from main.
  -> Now you have two branches, "main" and "readme-edits".
  
 # MAKING AND COMMITING CHANGES:
 -> Making and committing changes is where you can make and save changes in your repository.
 ->In github saved change is called as commits, each commits has a message saying why is the change maded
 
 1. Under the "readme-edits" branch you created, click the README.md file.
 2.Click the ðŸ–‹ to edit the file.

-> Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. 
-> When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.

1.Click the Pull requests tab of your hello-github repository.
2.Click New pull request.
3.In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with main (the original).
4.Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit.
5.Click Create pull request.
6.Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
7.Click Create pull request.

# MERGING PULL REQUEST

-> After you merge your pull request, the changes on your readme-edits branch will be incorporated into main.

1.Click Merge pull request to merge the changes into main.
2.Click Confirm merge. You will receive a message that the request was successfully merged and the request was closed.
3.Click Delete branch. Now that your pull request is merged and your changes are on main, you can safely delete the readme-edits branch.

FINALLY,
1.Set up of Git.
2.Downloading of Github Destop.
3.Importing of Code to Github.
